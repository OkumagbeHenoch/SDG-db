To develop a data-driven solution for **SDG 4: Quality Education**, we can address a specific problem within Nigeria's education system, based on the provided report. Here's a structured approach:

### Step 1: Problem Identification
From the **Southern Voice** report, Nigeria faces several challenges in achieving quality education, including:
- **Low enrollment and completion rates** at primary and secondary levels.
- **Gender disparity** in education access.
- **Inadequate educational infrastructure** (lack of schools, learning materials).
- **Teacher shortages** and underqualified staff.
  
We can focus on a specific problem, such as **improving enrollment and completion rates in primary education**.

### Step 2: Define the Data-Driven Solution
A data-driven solution could focus on:
- **Tracking student enrollment and dropout rates** by region.
- **Analyzing gender disparities** in education access.
- **Assessing teacher-student ratios** to identify gaps in educational resources.

**Solution Proposal**: Develop a database and dashboard that tracks:
1. **Student enrollment and dropout rates** per year, disaggregated by region and gender.
2. **Teacher-student ratios** in each region.
3. **Infrastructure data** such as the number of schools and facilities available.
4. **Progress in literacy and numeracy** through test scores.

### Step 3: Database Design
You can design a simple relational database with tables like:
1. **Students Table**: Stores details about students, including region, gender, enrollment date, and dropout status.
   - Columns: `StudentID`, `Name`, `Gender`, `Region`, `EnrollmentDate`, `DropoutDate`
   
2. **Schools Table**: Contains data on schools, their locations, and the number of teachers and students.
   - Columns: `SchoolID`, `Region`, `NumberOfTeachers`, `NumberOfStudents`, `FacilitiesAvailable`
   
3. **Performance Table**: Stores student test scores and performance data.
   - Columns: `StudentID`, `TestDate`, `TestScore`, `Subject`

4. **Teachers Table**: Contains information about the number of teachers and their qualifications.
   - Columns: `TeacherID`, `SchoolID`, `Qualification`, `Region`

### Step 4: Data Analysis
- **Enrollment and Dropout Rates**: Calculate the percentage of students who enroll and drop out per year, by region and gender.
- **Teacher-Student Ratio**: Analyze the ratio of teachers to students in each region to identify areas with teacher shortages.
- **Performance Analysis**: Track literacy and numeracy improvements by analyzing student performance over time.

### Step 5: Using Microsoft Excel as the User Interface
1. **Data Input**: Excel can be used to input and store the data in tables similar to a database.
2. **Pivot Tables**: Use pivot tables to analyze the data and generate key insights, such as:
   - Enrollment rates per region.
   - Gender disparity in school completion.
   - Teacher-student ratios across different regions.
   
3. **Dashboard Creation**: In Excel, create a dashboard that presents:
   - **Enrollment and Dropout Trends**: Line or bar charts showing enrollment and dropout rates over time, by gender and region.
   - **Teacher-Student Ratios**: A map or bar chart showing the ratios across regions.
   - **Performance Analysis**: A table showing average test scores in literacy and numeracy.
